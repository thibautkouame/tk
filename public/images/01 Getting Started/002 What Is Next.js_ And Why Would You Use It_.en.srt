00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,880
<v Narrator>So, what is NextJS?</v>

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,470
And why could learning NextJS be a good idea?

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,270
And why could NextJS in general,

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,130
be helpful to us as a React developer?

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,110
If we visit nextjs.org, the official NextJS website,

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,110
we learn that NextJS is the react framework for production.

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,250
Okay, so that sounds like a good argument.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,490
We all want to build production apps, right?

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,090
So NextJS is certainly helpful then, but wait a second.

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,540
What exactly does this mean?

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,470
So NextJS calls itself a React framework for production

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,110
and that name makes a lot of sense

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,490
because NextJS offers a lot of features that make building

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,930
large scale production ready, React apps easier.

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,130
But I personally also like to call NextJS

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,710
a full stack framework for ReactJS.

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,570
And it's the full stack part

18
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,200
which I want to highlight here.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,430
But I will come back to that.

20
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,270
Let's first of all, focus on the framework part.

21
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,270
Isn't ReactJS itself, already a framework or a library?

22
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,150
Well, indeed it is.

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,900
React is labeled a JavaScript library

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,150
for building user interfaces.

25
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,030
And that means that it's a third party package

26
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,930
which you can add to your front end projects.

27
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,580
So it's all about client side Java script code in the end.

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,250
And you can use React there

29
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,020
to build interactive user interfaces.

30
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,820
And it's a library that makes building

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,090
complex user interfaces way easier

32
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,170
than it would be with just JavaScript.

33
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,880
I got separate courses and videos on React

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,260
where I explain why React is awesome.

35
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,400
So I'll not focus on this here.

36
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,840
So React already is such a library

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,440
and it's called a library because in its core,

38
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,020
it's really only focusing on that user interface part,

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,680
on components, state props.

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
If you want to build large scale React projects,

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,190
you typically also need to add extra libraries for routing,

42
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,000
maybe libraries that help you with authentication

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,720
and things like that.

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,610
Now NextJS is labeled a framework

45
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,570
and a framework that builds up on React.

46
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,140
Now the difference between a framework and a library

47
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,130
in the end is that a framework is bigger.

48
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,260
It has more features than a library.

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,080
It's focusing on more things instead of just a single thing.

50
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,850
And it's also giving you clear rules,

51
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,140
a clear guidance on how you should write your code,

52
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,990
how you should structure your files and so on.

53
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,630
And all these are things which NextJS does

54
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,300
as you're going to learn from this course.

55
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,660
But it's also a framework

56
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,020
building up on another library already on React

57
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,770
because it enhances React, you could say.

58
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,400
It makes building large scale React apps easier.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,270
And that's the part where we're back

60
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,540
on this for production part here.

61
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,900
NextJS has the goal to make the life easier

62
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,140
for you as a React developer.

63
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,730
And it builds up on React,

64
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,910
it enhances React by adding many core features

65
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,440
which you have to add to React apps on your own otherwise.

66
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,600
Things like routing, but also many other things.

67
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,270
And I'll come back to that in just a second.

68
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,080
And we're going to dive into the key features

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,390
added by NextJS.

70
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,300
But NextJS simply adds a lot of features to your React app.

71
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,600
They then are there out of the box

72
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,950
once you start using NextJS and it definitely ensures

73
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,670
that you don't have to reinvent the wheel as often.

74
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,000
You don't have to add as many third party libraries

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,100
to solve common problems, which you need in bigger apps,

76
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,450
in which you typically need to solve

77
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,810
when building real production React apps.

78
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,000
And that's why NextJS is called a framework

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,720
because it has a lot of features, clear rules.

80
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,970
Why it's a framework for React;

81
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,640
because it builds up on React.

82
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,180
It enhances React, it uses React.

83
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,970
You still write React code.

84
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,370
You still build React components,

85
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,410
but it's a framework for production

86
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,050
because it adds all those missing features

87
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,190
which you typically do need to add to React apps

88
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,520
to really prepare them for production

89
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,000
and to solve common problems.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,440
And with that, let's now take a closer look

91
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,960
at the actual features added by NextJS

92
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,250
so that we understand where it helps us exactly

93
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,123
and why using it is a great idea and makes our life easier.
