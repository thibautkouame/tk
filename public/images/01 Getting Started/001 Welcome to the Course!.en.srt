<v ->Hi, and welcome to this course.</v>

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,540
My name is Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller,

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,240
and I will be your instructor in this course.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,240
Now, this course is about NextJS, a framework for ReactJS.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,460
And that might sound strange,

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,860
because ReactJS itself already is a JavaScript library,

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,100
but over the next lectures, I will explain

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,883
what exactly NextJS is,

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,170
and why using it could be a good idea.

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,240
Now, I can already say that learning it

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,410
is a good idea though, because NextJS is super popular,

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,060
and it does make building React apps,

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,620
large scale React apps but also small React apps,

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,120
way easier, because it will give you

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,610
solutions for common problems,

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,000
which you have to solve over and over again.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,840
And which you'll face in basically

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,710
any React project you might be working on.

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,790
Therefore, NextJS is amazing,

20
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,080
it is super popular, and in this course

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,870
you're going to learn it from the ground up, step by step.

22
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,550
You don't need to know anything

23
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,540
about NextJS to get started,

24
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,100
and you will get all the theory,

25
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,730
the behind the scenes knowledge,

26
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,610
small demos and examples,

27
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,790
and all the bigger projects in this course to ensure

28
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,640
that by the end of the course, you know how to use NextJS,

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,500
You know why you use it, what its core features are,

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,340
and you will be able to build your own NextJS project

31
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,590
once you're finished with this course.

32
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,020
Now, to see what's in the course, just continue

33
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,520
because I got an entire lecture where I walk you

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,680
through the course, and the content of this course,

35
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,650
and of course all that will look at the course curriculum.

36
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,470
This course is packed with knowledge,

37
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,620
and therefore, let's not waste any time,

38
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,860
and let's dive right in,

39
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,140
and let's start with the most important question first.

40
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,730
What exactly is NextJS and

41
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,353
why is using it maybe a good idea?
