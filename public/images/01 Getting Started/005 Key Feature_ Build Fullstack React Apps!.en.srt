00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,740
<v Instructor>Now NextJS has more amazing features,</v>

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,370
but the last key feature,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,200
which I want to point out here,

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,360
is the feature, which is most important

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,360
for me labeling NextJS a full stack framework.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,060
Because NextJS also makes it easy

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,500
for us as a developer to add backend code

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,310
to our react project.

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,280
So to build a full stack react project,

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,610
where we don't just have the client side code

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,540
maybe with service side pre rendering,

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,030
but where we also have standalone backend code,

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,110
that for example, works with the file system

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,670
or reaches out to a database.

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,980
With NextJS it's very easy to add

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,170
our own backend API into our react project

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,330
using NodeJS code.

18
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,740
So we can easily add such code to our Next react apps

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,800
when using NextJS.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,510
And that allows us to add code for storing data

21
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,650
to a database or to files,

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,030
getting data from there, adding authentication

23
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,500
and all off that.

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,770
That's easy to add with NextJS,

25
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,130
we can stay in one project,

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,180
we have to know some NodeJS code forded arguably,

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,250
but we would have to know that anyways

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,510
when we build our own backend,

29
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,550
and then we don't have to build a

30
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,200
standalone REST API project,

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,530
but instead we can work on one project,

32
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,080
our Next project, and add all the client's side code,

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,950
our react user interface,

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,510
and also blend in our backend API code.

35
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,050
That's why NextJS is amazing.

36
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,010
And these are all the core features

37
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,720
I wanted to point out here,

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,750
and which we're of course going to learn about

39
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,940
in depth in this course,

40
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,653
and even more than that
