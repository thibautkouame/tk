1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,840
<v Maximilian>Now, before we dive</v>

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,710
into all those NextJS features

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,530
and learn them in depth,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,580
I wanna give you a general overview

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,000
of what you can expect from this course

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,340
and which content will be in this course.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,710
Of course, also simply go through the curriculum,

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,190
which you can see to see what's included in the course

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,520
and when you're going to learn what.

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,190
But in general, you could say that this course

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,110
has three main types of content,

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,140
three main content blocks.

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,530
We have the basics and foundation block,

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,070
which is about all these key features you have to know

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,000
when working with NextJS

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,060
and where I will introduce those key features

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,850
with theory and small examples.

18
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,950
We then also dive into many more advanced concepts

19
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,130
throughout this course,

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,020
the concepts which you will need

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,610
for your real apps you're building,

22
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,300
for the production-ready apps you're building.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,090
And we'll also have summary content.

24
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,710
So summaries and refreshers,

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,470
which are there to save your time

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,410
to allow you to quickly summarize

27
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,890
what you learned or to fill gaps, which you might have,

28
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,470
for example, related to React.

29
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,380
Now, in the course modules

30
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,730
that make up this basics and foundation block,

31
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,330
and that's important, by the way.

32
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,210
These blocks are not the course sections

33
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,670
but the categories you could group

34
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,680
those course sections into.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,350
We will have more course sections

36
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,420
than what you will see on this slide.

37
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,270
Here I'm just outlining the main concepts

38
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,080
and categories of content you will learn.

39
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,920
So in this basics and foundation block of content,

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,210
you will, for example, learn about file-based routing.

41
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,690
We will have a course section on that.

42
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,740
We are, of course, also going to take a very close look

43
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,370
at page pre-rendering, Server-side Rendering

44
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,350
and fetching data for page pre-rendering.

45
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,410
So preparing and fetching data on the server side

46
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,420
instead of on the client side.

47
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,800
And when to use which approach

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,210
because it turns out that we will have different approaches

49
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,070
and different solutions here.

50
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,070
We will also explore how we can combine NextJS features

51
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,940
and NextJS pages with standard React features,

52
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,860
standard React components

53
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,650
and features like context and refs

54
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,730
and everything that makes up React.

55
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,563
And you'll see

56
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:35,964
that it is very straightforward and every easy.

57
00:02:35,964 --> 00:02:38,997
Nonetheless, we're going to take a look at that as well.

58
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:43,450
And we are also going to explore API routes

59
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,040
and how we can build fullstack applications with NextJS.

60
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,120
So these are all the core concepts

61
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,190
which we'll explore in depth throughout this course.

62
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,630
But then we're also going to dive into advanced concepts.

63
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,900
We are going to explore

64
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,320
optimization opportunities, for example.

65
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,020
How we can set page metadata.

66
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,380
How we can optimize images

67
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,210
so that we serve small images and load them lazily.

68
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,950
Things like that.

69
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,510
We are going to look behind the scenes

70
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,200
and explore some theory.

71
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,020
In this course, you're not just going to learn how

72
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,290
to do something but also why

73
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,603
and what happens behind the scenes.

74
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,990
We are, of course, also exploring deployment

75
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,860
and configuring our app for deployment,

76
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,970
different ways of building a NextJS application

77
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,350
and I will show you a detailed deployment example

78
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,130
from A to Z where we, at the end,

79
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,790
have our NextJS project up and running

80
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,320
on a production server.

81
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,450
In this course, we are also going

82
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,550
to explore authentication

83
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,760
and how you can add authentication

84
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,700
to your NextJS project

85
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,340
because it turns out that it works a bit differently

86
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,600
than in standard React apps,

87
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,530
that it's easier than in standard React apps

88
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,490
and you're going to learn what's easier

89
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,000
and how it works in this course.

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,870
And then regarding those summaries and refreshers,

91
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,200
as I said, they are there to save you time

92
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,020
and fill gaps because for example,

93
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,540
this course includes a full ReactJS refresher module.

94
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,210
Actually, that will be the next module

95
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,430
after this course section.

96
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,810
And you can, of course, skip that ReactJS refresher

97
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,920
if you already know React,

98
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,290
if you have no gaps and if you're ready

99
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,560
to dive into NextJS.

100
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,000
But if it has been some time

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,029
since you last worked with React,

102
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:45,910
if you especially have no experience

103
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,900
or not enough experience with functional components

104
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,590
and React hooks,

105
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,030
or if you only have basic React knowledge in general,

106
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,090
then this ReactJS refresher module is there for you

107
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,620
to ensure that we're all on the same page.

108
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,920
So definitely go through that next module in that case.

109
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,210
If you already have a solid understanding of ReactJS,

110
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,390
if you know functional components and React hooks,

111
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,693
then you can skip it.

112
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,490
And at the end of the course,

113
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,250
you will also find a NextJS summary module,

114
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,680
which summarizes all those key features again

115
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,120
and which, therefore, ensures

116
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,270
that if you're coming back to this course

117
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,770
in a couple of months or even years,

118
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,960
you've got a quick way

119
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,850
of going through all these key features again

120
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,110
without having to go through the entire course again.

121
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,240
And even if you just finished the course,

122
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,440
that summary module can be very nice

123
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,940
for quickly wrapping the course

124
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,530
and again, making sure that you fully understood

125
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,830
all those key features

126
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,730
and that you have the best possible preparation

127
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,733
for building your own NextJS projects.

128
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,270
Now, that's the content.

129
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,410
All this content will be taught with theory

130
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,780
and small demos and examples

131
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,500
but we will then also have multiple bigger projects,

132
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,720
more realistic projects

133
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,250
where we also apply what we learned

134
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,760
so that you have both,

135
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,400
small focused examples and the theory

136
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,030
and then the bigger picture

137
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,470
where everything comes together.

138
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,420
And you also, of course, should practice

139
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,560
what you learned.

140
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,890
From time to time throughout this course,

141
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,871
I will challenge you to try out something on your own

142
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:30,550
but I also challenge you right now

143
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,160
to do this even if I don't tell you to try something

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,170
on your own.

145
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,867
Consider pausing the course

146
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,800
and the videos from time to time

147
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,390
and try out the next steps on your own

148
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,300
without looking at my solution first.

149
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,170
So definitely also take a hands-on approach on your own

150
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,770
and apply what you learned in your own projects outside

151
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,810
of this course and also in the bigger course projects

152
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,660
before we then build them together throughout this course.

153
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,650
This will then ensure that you really understand

154
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,833
what you're learning.
