1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
<v ->[Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller] Now there is one special thing</v>

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,943
about this course

3
00:00:04,943 --> 00:00:06,420
which I wanna highlight.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,810
You got two main options

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,160
for going through that course,

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,240
for taking that course.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,480
You have the Standard Approach,

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,060
which is the approach which I recommend.

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,150
There you start at Lecture One

10
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,370
and Section One.

11
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,480
I guess you already did this,

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,580
but then you continue

13
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,040
going through this course,

14
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,890
step-by-step, lecture by lecture.

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,300
You can skip the ReactJS refresher module

16
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,870
if you don't need it, of course

17
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,530
but if you need to fill some gaps

18
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,540
also go through that course section.

19
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,620
And then at the end of this course,

20
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,810
you have that NextJS summary module,

21
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,060
which I mentioned.

22
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,500
There I will walk you

23
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,260
through all the core features again,

24
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,140
we'll again build

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,170
a small mini project again

26
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,650
and you will basically get

27
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,980
a quick overview of what you learned

28
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,030
and of all the core features.

29
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,600
That is a great course section to take,

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,210
once you're done with the course,

31
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,043
which is why

32
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:03,510
it is at the end of the course

33
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,690
to quickly get a quick overview

34
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,030
of the entire core concepts again.

35
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,960
And it's also a great module

36
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,900
to come back to in the future,

37
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,420
if you took the course

38
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,840
a couple of months ago

39
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,960
and you quickly wanna

40
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,220
go through it again

41
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,440
without going through

42
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,900
the entire course again,

43
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,130
which is of course not that short.

44
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,750
And that's the standard approach

45
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,610
which I recommend.

46
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,800
That you simply go through that course

47
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,970
and then take the summary module

48
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,623
as a well, summary module.

49
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
But you can also take the Summary Approach

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,290
as I'd like to call it.

51
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,660
We could also call it

52
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,940
the Quickstart approach,

53
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,740
which you can go for

54
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,000
if you're in a hurry.

55
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,380
If you have limited time.

56
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,710
If you wanna learn

57
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,770
the essence of NextJS

58
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,060
as quickly as possible.

59
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,480
For this approach,

60
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,340
you should skip all the Next modules

61
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,660
up to this NextJS summary module.

62
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,550
Only take their ReactJS refresher module

63
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,650
first if you need it.

64
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,990
So take that first

65
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,810
and then the NextJS summary module

66
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,330
if you need to refresh

67
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,720
your ReactJS knowledge,

68
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,956
otherwise skip that

69
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:15,660
ReactJS refresher module as well

70
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,250
and move forward to

71
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,750
the NextJS summary module.

72
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,250
With that, you will then learn

73
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,130
the essence of NextJS.

74
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,090
The core features that make up NextJS

75
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,350
in the shortest time possible,

76
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,880
you will still get a mini project there,

77
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,650
but of course we're not going to dive

78
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,700
into NextJS as deeply as we do it

79
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,270
in the entire course.

80
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,920
This module is built such that

81
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,330
you can go through it first

82
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,280
without taking the entire course first.

83
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,600
It is built such that

84
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
it works stand alone.

85
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,742
And it then summarizes the core concepts

86
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:53,680
NextJS has to offer,

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,020
of course without diving as deeply

88
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,610
into those concepts

89
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,300
and into your different configuration options,

90
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,020
as the rest of this course does.

91
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,740
This course section,

92
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,060
this summary section

93
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,760
will also not include

94
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,260
all the features I cover

95
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,210
in this course in general.

96
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,760
We'll not dive into authentication Deere

97
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,310
or image optimization, for example,

98
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,460
simply because it is a summary module,

99
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,780
an overview module.

100
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,010
This course is as long as it is

101
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,090
for a good reason.

102
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,890
And therefore the summary module

103
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,150
does not replace this course.

104
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,260
But if you just wanna get

105
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,310
a quick overview of NextJS,

106
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,660
if you wanna quickly dive into it

107
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,670
and learn about the core features

108
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,160
and you wanna dive deeply

109
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,550
into the course later,

110
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,760
you can go for this summary approach

111
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,830
and go through this summary module first

112
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,550
and then possibly come back

113
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,840
to the entire course

114
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,500
at a later point of time

115
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,860
to go through that as well.

116
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,010
Now, as I mentioned,

117
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,500
my recommended approach

118
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,000
is the left one though.

119
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,190
That is the approach

120
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,930
with which you will get the most

121
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,190
out of this course.

122
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,520
That is the approach

123
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,500
with which you will

124
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,040
really learn NextJS in depth.

125
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,280
But if you're in a hurry,

126
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,623
you can go for the right approach instead.
