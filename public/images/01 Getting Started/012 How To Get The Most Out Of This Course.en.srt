00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,740
<v Maximilian>Now last but not least,</v>

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,040
to conclude this first introductory course section,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,320
I wanna make sure that you get the most out of this course.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,690
I wanna ensure that you have a great learning experience

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,230
and that you're able to learn NextJS

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,080
in the best possible way.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,520
And therefore, I got a couple of recommendations

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,860
and tips and tricks for you to ensure that this is the case.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,990
Now, obviously this is a video-based course,

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,080
it's a video-on-demand course

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,670
and therefore you should take advantage of this.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,400
You should of course watch all those lectures,

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,450
preferably in order,

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,500
and you should watch them at your pace, set your own speed.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,140
You can use the video player controls to speed me up

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,110
or slow me down if I'm going too fast.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,850
It is also perfectly fine and normal to pause and rewind

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,290
and to go back to earlier lectures

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,600
to ensure that you really understand what I'm explaining.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,920
If something is not clear after watching a video,

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,730
watch the video again, that is a normal part of learning.

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,670
Repetition is a normal part of learning,

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,990
and therefore you should use the fact

24
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,560
that this is a video-on-demand course

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,370
and that you can watch videos as often as you want.

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,860
But if you wanna get the most out of the course,

27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,560
don't just watch the videos also code along and practice,

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,650
even without me telling you.

29
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,550
I will sometimes challenge you

30
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,420
to try out something on your own,

31
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,730
but I do recommend that you always code along.

32
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,960
That you pause the videos often

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,570
and try out the next steps on your own

34
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,920
before we write code together.

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,300
Now, of course there will be failures with that approach

36
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,650
but that is how you learn the most,

37
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,313
so definitely consider coding along and practicing.

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,360
Now, when you run into errors and problems

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,320
try to solve those on your own.

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,860
Really, that is the biggest part of learning,

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,060
fixing errors and problems on your own.

42
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,100
Don't ask for help immediately,

43
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,500
you will learn way more if you solve problems on your own.

44
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,210
I would even argue that solving problems

45
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,540
is the most important skill as a successful developer.

46
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,790
So therefore use Google, use Stack Overflow,

47
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,570
use resources like this

48
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,250
to find out what could be causing a problem in your code.

49
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,900
And also use my code attachments,

50
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,600
which you find on the last lecture of every module.

51
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,760
My code is attached as a GitHub repository,

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,500
in the last lecture of every module,

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,510
you will find the links to this GitHub repository

54
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,310
to different branches there,

55
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,430
where the different branches represent

56
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,450
the different course sections.

57
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,400
And then in a given branch,

58
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,310
let's say in the authentication branch here,

59
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,320
you can always go to commits here on the right,

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,630
and you will see the different code snapshots

61
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,460
which I created when I recorded that course section.

62
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,920
And you can then always click on this button here

63
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,200
to browse this code repository at this point,

64
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
and then you'll find my code snapshot

65
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,510
at this point in the course section.

66
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,180
You can then also download it as a zip file

67
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,520
or clone the repository.

68
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,590
And this commit messages here which I left here

69
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,400
should help you find out to which part of a section,

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,780
so to which lecture, a specific code snapshot belongs.

71
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,280
If you just watched the lecture where we added log out

72
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,130
and you wanna compare your code

73
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,670
after this lecture with mine,

74
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,653
it's probably this commit which you wanna use.

75
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,100
So that's how you should use my code attachments

76
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,410
when using my code to compare it to yours.

77
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,170
Now, of course there might be problems

78
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,020
which you just can't solve,

79
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,060
where you don't find the reason for the problem.

80
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,070
And in this case, definitely use the fact

81
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,820
that you're in a community of developers,

82
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,720
help each other and learn together.

83
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,460
We got a Discord channel, a link can be found attached

84
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,440
and in an earlier lecture in this course.

85
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,740
We've got a Discord channel which you can join for free

86
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,550
to discuss with fellow developers, share projects,

87
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,550
help each other and of course also we'll discuss matters

88
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,780
that are not related to this course,

89
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,330
it's a general learning oriented Discord channel after all.

90
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,480
And you can of course also use the Q&amp;A Board,

91
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,120
which comes with this course

92
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,620
to post any other problems you might have

93
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,597
and to also help others there.

94
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:37,170
Because ultimately, helping others,

95
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,210
solving problems on your own,

96
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,270
coding along and watching the videos at your pace,

97
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,420
that is what will ensure

98
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,443
that you will get the most out of this course.
