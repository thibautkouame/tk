1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,290
<v Maximilian>So we did create that NextJS project</v>

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,270
here in the terminal with NPX create-next-app,

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,870
and that gave us a folder which looks like this,

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,030
which has this kind of content.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,300
Attached, you also find that starting project

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,160
in case it changes over time or looks slightly different

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,730
because the starting template was changed, for example.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,200
So attached, you find that exact project snapshot,

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,750
which I have here.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,690
If you do download the attached snapshot though,

11
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,000
there is one extra step you need to go through.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,040
You need to open the terminal,

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,950
and you can use the one built into Visual Studio Code,

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,040
which is your default terminal.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,770
Your default command prompt

16
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,210
which ships with your operating system,

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,980
just already integrated into Visual Studio Code,

18
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,450
and conveniently, also already navigated

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,360
into this project folder.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,110
So any commands you run here

21
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,710
will execute in the context of your project folder.

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,540
And here you then need to run npm install

23
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,530
if you use that attached snapshot.

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,810
Because that will then install

25
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,860
all the dependencies of this project

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,150
as defined here in package.json,

27
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,300
and store them and their dependencies

28
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,600
in the node modules folder.

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,700
So that's also a folder in which will never work.

30
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,490
The three important folders for us here

31
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,030
are pages, public, and styles,

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,150
though pages is by far the most important one.

33
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,370
Styles, as you might guess, holds some style files.

34
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,880
We can ignore that for now.

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,460
We'll work on that soon.

36
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,460
And public simply holds public resources our page might use.

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,410
Something like images, for example.

38
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,110
Now one thing you might see here in public though,

39
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,700
is that unlike in a regular React app,

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,040
which you, for example,

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,820
created with create React app with that extra tool,

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,630
that there in a standard React app,

43
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,120
you have a index HTML file in the public folder.

44
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,780
Here in the NextJS app, you don't have that.

45
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,960
And the reason for this

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,400
is that NextJS has this built in pre-rendering.

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,380
And whilst it gives you a single page application,

48
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,790
that single page is dynamically pre-rendered

49
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,740
when a request reaches the server

50
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,740
so that you do return an initial page with content.

51
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,860
That is what I talked about earlier in this course as well.

52
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,060
This server-side rendering and the pre-rendering of pages.

53
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,893
And hence for us,

54
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:38,210
the pages folder will be the most important folder

55
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,480
because that is where we will set up

56
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,320
that file based routing,

57
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,070
and that is there for the folder,

58
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,680
which is important for us to define the different pages

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,563
that should make up our application here.
